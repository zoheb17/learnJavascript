// JavaScript Function and Function Expressions

// A function is an independent block of code that performs a specific task, while a function expression is a way to store functions in variables.



// Example 1: JavaScript Function Call

// If we run the above code, we won't get any output. But why?

// It's because creating a function doesn't mean we are executing the code inside it. In other words, the function is ready and available for us to execute whenever we choose.

// And if we want to use the function, we need to call it.

function greet(name){
    console.log(`hello ${name}`);
